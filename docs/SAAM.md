He had a global presence and influence, and his innovative art and visionary ideas continue to inspire a new generation of artists.</p> <p>Born in 1932 in Seoul, Korea, to a wealthy industrial family, Paik and his family fled Korea in 1950 at the outset of the Korean War, first to Hong Kong, then to Japan. Paik graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1956, and then traveled to Germany to pursue his interest in avant-garde music, composition and performance. There he met John Cage and George Maciunas and became a member of the neo-dada Fluxus movement. In 1963, Paik had his legendary one-artist exhibition at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal, Germany, that featured his prepared television sets, which radically altered the look and content of television.</p> <p>After immigrating to the United States in 1964, he settled in New York City where he expanded his engagement with video and television, and had exhibitions of his work at the New School, Galerie Bonino and the Howard Wise Gallery. In 1965, Paik was one of the first artists to use a portable video camcorder. In 1969, he worked with the Japanese engineer Shuya Abe to construct an early video-synthesizer that allowed Paik to combine and manipulate images from different sources. The Paik-Abe video synthesizer transformed electronic moving-image making. Paik invented a new artistic medium with television and video, creating an astonishing range of artworks, from his seminal videotape <i>Global Groove</i> (1973) that broke new ground, to his sculptures <i>TV Buddha</i> (1974), and <i>TV Cello</i> (1971); to installations such as <i>TV Garden</i> (1974), <i>Video Fish</i> (1975) and <i>Fin de Siecle II</i> (1989); videotapes <i>Living with the Living Theatre</i> (1989) and <i>Guadalcanal Requiem</i> (1977/1979); and global satellite television productions such as <i>Good Morning Mr. Orwell,</i> which broadcast from the Centre Pompidou in Paris and a WNET-TV studio in New York City Jan. 1, 1984.</p> <p>Paik has been the subject of numerous exhibitions, including two major retrospectives, and has been featured in major international art exhibitions including Documenta, the Venice Biennale and the Whitney Biennial.

			transcription: "Normally when you use the Internet there's lots and lots of people who can see what you're doing. Advertisers can track your movements across the Internet. Your local Internet service provider can look at the websites that you're visiting, and so on and so forth. The "
			Autonomy Cube " is a sculpture that tries to imagine what the Internet might look like if this were not the case. The creates an open wi-fi network that anybody in the museum can use. But when you connect to this network, it's a very different kind of Internet connection than you might otherwise have. It routs all the traffic over something called the Tor network, which is an infrastructure that sits on top of the Internet and is designed to create anonymity for people using the Internet. It does this by bouncing your Internet traffic through a series of relays around the world. If you use the Autonomy Cube, you might notice that you're being served webpages in Polish or Spanish, French, or German. And the reason for that is because the normal Internet thinks that you're an anonymous user at a random location somewhere else in the world. This Tor network was originally built by the military and by the State department in order to allow other people around the world to circumvent Internet censorship and surveillance in totalitarian countries.

## Sorting 

Sorting results can be done on most fields using a `?sort` parameter with fields as the target. 

?> Read the full [{JSON:API} specification on sorting](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sorting).                                            

#### Examples

> ```
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/artworks?sort=-changed
> ```
> Sorting on the `changed` field returns the most recently updated artworks Note that the preceding "minus" sign (-) specifies descending order.

> ```
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/books?sort=sort=-year_published,author
> ```
> Sorting on multiple fields.

## Filtering
Filters are one of the most useful things about the JSON API spec. You can create relatively complex queries using filter parameters.

?> Read the full [{JSON:API} specification on filtering](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-filtering).                                            

#### Examples

> ```
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/artworks?filter[object-number][path]=object_number&filter[object-number][value]=2002.23
> ```
> Get the artwork where the Object Number is "2002.23".


> ```
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/artworksartworks?filter[title][path]=title&filter[title][value]=robot&filter[title][operator]=CONTAINS
> ```
> Get artworks where the title contains the word "robot".


> ```
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/artwork?filter[fitler-group][group][conjunction]=AND&filter[classifications-filter][condition][path]=classifications.title&filter[classifications-filter][condition][value]=Painting&filter[classifications-filter][condition][memberOf]=fitler-group&filter[on-view-filter][condition][path]=is_on_view&filter[on-view-filter][condition][value]=1&filter[on-view-filter][condition][memberOf]=fitler-group
> ```
> Get artworks where the Classification category is "Painting" and the object is currently on view in the museum.


## Paging
Requests that return large numbers of records will be spread across multiple pages. By default, a request returns 20 records per page. Use the `page[limit]` and `page[offset]` parameters to implement paging.

#### Example

> ```shell
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/artworks?page[limit]=20&page[offset]=1&sort=-changed
> ```
> Get the second page of all artworks sorted by updated date. 

## Relationships
Resources are returned with a `relationships` property which contains links to related media (image and audio files), categories, or other related resources. These related items can be retrieved in a separate API request using the `link`, or can be included in a single request by specifying which relationships to include in the results using the `?include` parameter.

?> Read the full [{JSON:API} specification on relationships](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-relationships).                                            

#### Examples

> ```
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/audio/8abede9a-b374-4255-9d05-723103cdede1?include=file
> ```
> Get a specific audio resource, and include the audio file data.


> ```
> https://api.si.edu/saam/v1/collection/artworks/dd19ac03-04e8-4d20-bfe9-ecfc238ebd54?include=artwork_images,artwork_images.artwork_image,artists,classifications,highlights,locations
> ```
> Get a specific artwork, and include data for the artwork images and categories.
